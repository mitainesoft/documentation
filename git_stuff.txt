** Git push: username, password, how to avoid? **
ref: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8588768/git-push-username-password-how-to-avoid
1. Generate an SSH key

	Linux/Mac

	Open terminal to create ssh keys:

	cd ~                 #Your home directory
	ssh-keygen -t rsa    #Press enter for all values
	For Windows

	(Only works if the commit program is capable of using certificates/private & public ssh keys)

	Use Putty Gen to generate a key
	Export the key as an open SSH key

2. Associate the SSH key with the remote repository

	This step varies, depending on how your remote is set up.

	If it is a GitHub repository and you have administrative privileges, go to settings and click 'add SSH key'. Copy the contents of your ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub into the field labeled 'Key'.
	If your repository is administered by somebody else, give the administrator your id_rsa.pub.
	3. Set your remote URL to a form that supports SSH 1

	If you have done the steps above and are still getting the password prompt, make sure your repo URL is in the form

		git+ssh://git@github.com/username/reponame.git
	as opposed to
		https://github.com/username/reponame.git
